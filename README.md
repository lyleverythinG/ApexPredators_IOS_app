# Apex Predator IOS App(Swift)
_This IOS app, developed using Swift, is the second app I created in this language as I continue my journey in learning IOS development._
# NOTE
- I followed a Udemy course, which is this one: https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/.
- After I finished this app from the course, I made changes to the project for practice and learning purposes. (Can be found in main or in `feature/add-code-adjustments-and-improvements` branch)
- Added changes related to the coding challenges for this section from the course.

# Changes (Personal)
- Added view model named `PredatorsViewModel` and transfer applicable code areas to the view model.
- Added descriptive comments to `classes`, `enums`, `functions`, and etc.
- Extracted sub views. (Ex. `ReusableScaledToFitImg`).
- Standardized Text. (`APText`)
# Changes (Coding Challenges from Course)
- Added a navigation when a predator is tapped from the details screen. (Redirects to a view that shows the predator in full screen.)
- Added an info card when the user taps the predator from the map.
- Added deletion of predator functionality from the list.
- Add filtering by movie. <- Not yet implemented. Will implement it soon.
  
# Functionalities
- View Predator Information: Displays details such as name, type, movies they appeared in, and memorable scenes.
- Search Functionality: Search predators by `name`.
- Sort Option: Allows sorting the predator list alphabetically or not.
- Filter Functionality: Filter the predator list by habitat type: `Land`, `Air`, or `Sea`. Defaults to `all`
- Map Integration: Added a map using `MapKit` and display the different predators based in their location.
- Map Style Toggle: Switch between `satellite` and `standard` map styles.
- Read More Navigation: Added a Link view, for `read more` functionality.
