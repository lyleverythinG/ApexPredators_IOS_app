# Apex Predator IOS App(Swift)
_This ios app made with Swift is the second app I've created in this language as I continue my journey in learning ios development._
# NOTE
- I followed a Udemy course, which is this one: https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/..
# Functionalities
- View predator information. (Ex. name, type, movies appeared in, movie scenes.)
- Search function. (By Name)
- Option to sort the predators from the list to alphabetical or not. (Based in Name)
- Can filter list of predators by Land, Air, or Sea.
- Added a map from `MapKit` which shows the different predators.
- Added toggle option to switch map style from satellite to standard and vice-versa.
- Added `Link` for `Read More`  navigation option.
